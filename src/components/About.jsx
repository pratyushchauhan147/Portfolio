                I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer currently pursuing my Computer Science Engineering degree at KIIT University. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I enjoy building dynamic, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.

                I completed my schooling at City Montessori School, Lucknow, where my interest in technology first sparked. Over time, I honed my skills by working on various projects, gaining hands-on experience in web development, UI/UX design, and problem-solving.

                Apart from coding, I have a creative side and enjoy crafting intuitive user experiences through sleek and functional designs. Iâ€™m always eager to explore new technologies, collaborate on innovative projects, and contribute to open-source initiatives.
